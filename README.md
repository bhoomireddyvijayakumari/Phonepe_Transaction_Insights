# Phonepe_Transaction_Insights

# Problem Statement:

With the increasing reliance on digital payment systems like PhonePe, understanding the dynamics of transactions, user engagement, and insurance-related data is crucial for improving services and targeting users effectively. This project aims to analyze and visualize aggregated values of payment categories, create maps for total values at state and district levels, and identify top-performing states, districts, and pin codes.

Business Use Cases:

Customer Segmentation: Identify distinct user groups based on spending habits to tailor marketing strategies.

Fraud Detection: Analyze transaction patterns to spot and prevent fraudulent activities.

Geographical Insights: Understand payment trends at state and district levels for targeted marketing.

Payment Performance: Evaluate the popularity of different payment categories for strategic investments.

User Engagement: Monitor user activity to develop strategies that enhance retention and satisfaction.

Product Development: Use data insights to inform the creation of new features and services.

Insurance Insights: Analyze insurance transaction data to improve product offerings and customer experience.

Marketing Optimization: Tailor marketing campaigns based on user behavior and transaction patterns.

Trend Analysis: Examine transaction trends over time to anticipate demand fluctuations.


Competitive Benchmarking: Compare performance against competitors to identify areas for improvement.
Approach:

Data Extraction:

Clone the GitHub repository containing PhonePe transaction data and load it into a SQL database.

SQL Database and Table Creation:

Set up a SQL database using a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Create tables to store data from the different folders:

Aggregated Tables:

Aggregated_user: Holds aggregated user-related data.

Aggregated_transaction : Contains aggregated values for map-related data.

Aggregated_insurance: Stores aggregated insurance-related data.

Map Tables:

Map_user: Contains mapping information for users.

Map_map: Holds mapping values for total amounts at state and district levels.

Map_insurance: Includes mapping information related to insurance.

Top Tables:

Top_user: Lists totals for the top users.

Top_map: Contains totals for the top states, districts, and pin codes.

Top_insurance: Lists totals for the top insurance categories.

Data Analysis Using Python:

Utilize Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze the results from the SQL queries.

Create visualizations (bar charts, pie charts) to display aggregated values and top performers.

Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit, to present the analysis results. Ensure the dashboard integrates visualizations for real-time data exploration and insights.
